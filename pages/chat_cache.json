    "response": "It looks like you're interested in the kinds of questions people are asking.  Based on the data, the most frequently asked *relevant* questions seem to be about:\n\n* **Quotation Status and Cost:**  Many questions revolve around the different statuses of quotations (Draft, Preview), their associated costs, and how these relate to other factors like urgency and lead source.\n\n* **Leads and Their Value:**  There's also significant interest in understanding leads, particularly their urgency, associated costs, and which professions they come from.\n\n* **Performance of Key Account Managers:** Questions about which Key Account Managers are creating the most quotations and the value of those quotations appear frequently.\n\nThere are also some irrelevant or nonsensical entries, likely due to user error or testing. While \"helogelo kxlzdk\" and variations of \"hello my name is...\" are frequent, they don't provide meaningful information about user needs.  Similarly, single words like \"Admin\" and \"nan\" lack context.  Therefore, while frequent, they are not truly *asked questions* in a meaningful sense.  Finally, your request \"what are the most asked un relatable questions\" is itself difficult to interpret.  It may be asking what are the most commonly asked questions with little or no relevance to the task. In this dataset based on frequency alone \"helogelo kxlzdk\" appears frequently, but lacks any relational meaning.  This may also apply to variations of \"hello my name is...\"\n"

    "response": "It looks like users are most interested in lead and quotation information, particularly around pricing, urgency, and the relationship between the two.  They also frequently ask about the performance of Key Account Managers/Creators.  There's some noise in the data with greetings and typos, but the core questions are consistent.  Do you want me to generate some reports or dashboards based on these questions?  Or perhaps suggest some ways to improve the data quality to reduce those non-business-related entries?\n"
