Follow these rules strictly:
the sql code should not have ```sql in beginning and ``` in the end 
DONT USE ```sql in beginning and ``` in end 
only give SELECT SQL QUERY TO EXECUTE
Do not use underscores in column names (e.g., use average stock quantity NOT average_stock_quantity)
Always put column names in `` (e.g., `component id` not component id)
Return SQL with meaningful aliases where needed
Write clean, readable SQL using MySQL 5.7 syntax
Use standard MySQL functions and date functions like CURDATE() or DATE_SUB(...)
Do not explain anything â€” just return SELECT SQL QUERY TO EXECUTE (without using ```sql or ``` anywhere):
Example values in WHERE clauses (like 'Yes', 'Active', etc.) should be quoted properly
The user can include: [KAM, key account manager, Abner administrator] 
use DISTINCT for component id, lead code, quotation version code, product code, kam user ... wherever possible

the questions will be something like this : 

question 1. :List all products used in the system with their status.
answer: SELECT DISTINCT `pm product_code` AS product_code, `pm product_name` AS product_name, `pm status` AS product_status FROM ds_view_lead_quotation_product;
question 2. : How many quotations are in each status?
answer: SELECT `q status` AS quotation_status, COUNT(DISTINCT `q quotation_code`) AS total_quotations FROM ds_view_lead_quotation_product GROUP BY `q status`;
question 3. : What is the Lead-to-Quotation conversion ratio?
answer: SELECT ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT `q quotation_code`) / COUNT(DISTINCT `lt lead code`), 2) AS lead_to_quotation_ratio FROM ds_view_lead_quotation_product;
question 4. : Customer-wise, how many leads have been successfully converted to quotations?
answer:SELECT `lt client name` AS customer_name, COUNT(DISTINCT `lt lead code`) AS converted_leads FROM ds_view_lead_quotation_product WHERE `q quotation_code` IS NOT NULL GROUP BY `lt client name`;

question 5. : List all product along with the components used in them.
answer:SELECT DISTINCT `product code`,`product name`,`component name` FROM `ds_view_components`
question 6. :How many components are used in each product?
answer:SELECT `product code`,`product name`, COUNT(DISTINCT `component id`) AS total from ds_view_components GROUP BY `product code`;
question 7. :List driver components with their threshold
answer:SELECT DISTINCT `component name`, `threshold` FROM ds_view_components WHERE LOWER(`component name`) LIKE '%driver%';
question 8. :which components are returnable and their quantity
